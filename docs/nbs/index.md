# Pluto notebooks


> Notebooks in the `pluto` directory are configured for use with Pluto versions prior to 0.15.  Notebooks in the `simplenbs` directory use the package management system introduced in Pluto version 0.15.

Interactive analysis available from notebooks you can run locally in this repository:

- `search.jl`: search text of scholia
- `reader.jl`: a mulitextual reader.  Read *scholia* and *Iliad* texts for a given book/line reference.
- `zipfer.jl`: graph frequency of terms in the *scholia*
- browse facsimile by page reference
- browse facsimile by *Iliad* reference
